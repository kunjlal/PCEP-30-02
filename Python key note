Interpreted , High level language Object oriented language 
Source code -> interpreter -> output
Source code -> compiler-> Machine Code -> interpreter -> output

Disadvantage :
        debugging can be difficult 
        weak speed performance
       
       
       
Online Compiler:

https://replit.com/~   @Best compiler with efficent module 
# print()  # Display and Start a new line 
# print("Welcome")
# print("Welcome\n") @ next line character 
# print("Hello")
# for comment symbol
...
this is another way to manage multi line comment 
...

The type of data is # type()
First letter can be an alphabet or an underscore(_)
It's case sensitive language 

Example:

  x = 45 ; x_123=45
  y= "Hello" y_hn="hi"
  
  print(x)  print(x_123)
  print(y)  print(y_hn)
  
  type_printing = (type (y_hn))
  
  
  x=123
  print(x) # will give an error
  
  Multilpe variable declaration 
  x,y,z=1,"welcome","hello"
  print(x)
    print(y)
      print(z)
      
  x = y = z = 10
  print(x)
  print(y)
  print(z)
  
  print(x,y,z)
  
  
  abc="Hello, i am sandeep"
  print(abc)
  del abc
  print(abc)
  
Note:
  
You cannot use names that have a special meaning or which are reserved for a particular purpose in Python. For example - print has a special meaning, input is also reserved for a specific purpose, etc.

You can not use keywords as the variable names. For example - and, or, if, else, etc (We will cover these as we move further)

Keywords are those which have a special meaning and are already defined in Python. They are used to define the syntax of the coding.

You can not use inbuilt function names as the variable names such as print(), int(), input(), etc.  
  
  
Boolean and Literals
(True/False)
print (True > False)
print(type (True > False))
print (False > True)

print(1)
print (type(1))
print(type(200))
print(type(1.0))
print(type(1.))

Integers: number without any decimal part 

# octal number -- Other numeral system 
print(0o103)
# Hexadecimal Number:
print(0x103)
# Floating number
# float 
print(2.45)
print(5.0)
print(type(print(5.0))

# Scientif NUmber - Number with large number or small number
print(4e8)
print(5e9)
print(6e12)
print(7.5e12)
print(type(print(6e12))


Points to remember
Machine Language: The computer has its own language that consists of binary or hexadecimal instructions which are called machine language.

Source Code: A program that is written in a high-level programming language is called a source code.

Lexis: A set of words the language offers its users.

Syntax: Rules to decide if a certain group of words are a part of a valid code is called Syntax

Semantics: These are rules that decide if certain phrases make sense.

Alphabet: A set of symbols used to build words of a certain language
